Guide to Install and Use bypass-work-ink.js with Tampermonkey
The bypass-work-ink.js script automatically bypasses restrictions on https://work.ink/* websites. Follow this guide to install and use it seamlessly.
1. Install Tampermonkey
Tampermonkey is a browser extension required to run userscripts like bypass-work-ink.js. Install it on your preferred browser:

Chrome/Edge: Download from Chrome Web Store.
Firefox: Download from Firefox Add-ons.
Other browsers: Search for Tampermonkey in your browser's extension store.

After installation, the Tampermonkey icon will appear on your browser's toolbar.
2. Install the Script

Open the Tampermonkey Dashboard:
Click the Tampermonkey icon in your browser toolbar.
Select Dashboard > Click the + button to create a new script.


Copy the following code and paste it into the Tampermonkey editor:

// ==UserScript==
// @name         Bypass Work.ink Huyyhere
// @namespace    http://tampermonkey.net/
// @version      1.0.0
// @description  Ultimate bypasses work.ink
// @author       huyyhere
// @match        https://work.ink/*
// @icon         https://www.google.com/s2/favicons?sz=64&domain=work.ink
// @run-at       document-start
// @license      MIT
// @updateURL    https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Huyyhere/Bypass-work.ink/refs/heads/main/scripts.js
// @downloadURL  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Huyyhere/Bypass-work.ink/refs/heads/main/scripts.js
// @require      https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Huyyhere/Bypass-work.ink/refs/heads/main/scripts.js
// ==/UserScript==


Save the script by pressing Ctrl + S or selecting File > Save.
The script will automatically run when you visit any https://work.ink/* page.

3. How It Works

The script is triggered on page load (@run-at document-start) and bypasses restrictions on work.ink automatically.
It fetches additional code via the @require directive from GitHub.
Updates are checked automatically via the @updateURL.

4. Troubleshooting

Script not working?
Ensure Tampermonkey is enabled and the script is active in the Dashboard.
Verify your browser has an active internet connection (required for @require).
Check the browser console (F12) for errors.


Still having issues? Try changing @run-at document-start to @run-at document-end in the script header and save again.

5. Safety Notes

Source Verification: The script is sourced from Huyyhere's GitHub. Review the code at the @require URL for security.
Permissions: The script only runs on https://work.ink/* as specified by @match.
Updates: Keep the script updated to avoid issues or vulnerabilities.
